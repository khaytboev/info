<pre style="color: white; font-size: 25px">Certainly! Python is a powerful and versatile programming language that is
    widely used for various types of software development. Here's a comprehensive
    overview of Python:

<dl>

<dt>1. General Information</dt>

<dd>- Creator Guido van Rossum</dd>
<dd>- First Released: 1991</dd>
<dd>- Latest Version: As of June 2024, the latest stable version is Python 3.11</dd>
<dd>- Type: High-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language</dd>

<dt>2. Key Features</dt>
<dd>- Simple and Readable Syntax:** Python's syntax is clear and easy to read,
    making it an excellent choice for beginners.</dd>
<dd>- Interpreted Language: Python code is executed line-by-line, which makes
    debugging easier.</dd>
<dd>- Dynamically Typed: Variables in Python do not need explicit declaration to
    reserve memory space. The declaration happens automatically when a
    value is assigned to a variable.</dd>
<dd>- Object-Oriented: Supports object-oriented programming paradigms.</dd>
<dd>- Extensive Standard Library: Python has a large standard library that
    supports many common programming tasks, such as connecting to web
    servers, reading and modifying files, and working with data.</dd>

<dt> 3. Popular Uses</dt>
<dd>- Web Development: Frameworks like Django and Flask
- Data Science and Machine Learning: Libraries such as Pandas, NumPy,
    SciPy, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow</dd>
<dd>- Scripting and Automation: Used for writing scripts to automate tasks</dd>
<dd>- Software Development: Building applications with frameworks like PyQt or
    Tkinter</dd>
<dd>- System Administration: Managing systems and networks</dd>

<dt> 4. Important Libraries and Frameworks</dt>
<dd>- Web Development: Django, Flask, FastAPI</dd>
<dd>- Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy</dd>
<dd>- Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch</dd>
<dd>- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly</dd>
<dd>- Game Development: Pygame</dd>
<dd>- GUI Development: Tkinter, PyQt</dd>

 <dt>5. Community and Ecosystem</dt>
<dd>- PyPI (Python Package Index): The repository for Python packages, with
    over 200,000 packages available.</dd>
<dd>- Community: Large and active community, with extensive documentation
    and a wealth of tutorials, forums, and conferences such as PyCon.</dd>

<pre style="color: white; font-size: 25px">Overview of CSS
<dt>1. General Information</dt>
Developer: World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
First Released: December 17, 1996
Latest Version: CSS3 is the current standard, though CSS4 is being developed in
    modules.
2. Key Features
Styling Web Pages: CSS is used to control the layout and appearance of web
    pages, including colors, fonts, and spacing.
Separation of Content and Presentation: CSS allows the separation of
    document content (written in HTML or similar markup) from document
    presentation, including elements such as the layout, colors, and fonts.
Cascading Nature: The "Cascading" in CSS refers to the way styles can fall back
    from multiple sources. Styles can be applied from external stylesheets, internal
    stylesheets, and inline styles.
Responsive Design: CSS supports responsive design through media queries,
    which allows web pages to adjust their layout and appearance based on the
    device's screen size.
3. Basic Syntax
CSS is composed of style rules that tell the browser how to render each element on
    the page. A style rule consists of a selector and a declaration block.</pre>
